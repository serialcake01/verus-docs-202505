## 1. **Verus Blockchain: Purpose, Goals, and Unique Features**

**Summary of Understanding (from PRD, web research, and project docs):**
- **Verus is a next-generation, multi-chain blockchain protocol** designed for truth, privacy, and community empowerment.
- **Key innovations:**
  - **Smart Transactions (not smart contracts):** All core features (currencies, DeFi, identity, cross-chain, privacy) are protocol-level, consensus-validated, and not vulnerable to contract bugs.
  - **VerusID:** Decentralized, privacy-preserving identity system, core to user and asset management.
  - **PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service):** Anyone can launch a full-featured, interoperable blockchain or currency with no coding.
  - **DeFi and Currencies:** Native, MEV-resistant, protocol-level DeFi and currency primitives (including liquidity baskets, cross-chain, and ERC-20 bridging).
  - **Consensus:** Hybrid PoW/PoS (Proof of Power), 51% attack resistant, no premine, no VC, fully community-governed.
  - **Privacy:** zk-SNARKs at the protocol level, user-controlled privacy for transactions and identity.
  - **Developer Focus:** CLI and API are the main interfaces; documentation must empower both new and advanced users, and AI agents.

**Documentation must:**
- Teach not just *how* to use commands, but *why*—explaining the protocol’s unique architecture and security model.
- Emphasize Verus’ differences from EVM/contract-based chains (no smart contract bugs, protocol-level features, etc.).
- Highlight privacy, security, and user empowerment as core values.
- Provide clear, actionable examples and warnings for all commands, especially those with irreversible or security-sensitive effects.

## 2. **Enrichment Template: Foundation**

**All command documentation and JSON enrichment will:**
- Begin with a concise, context-aware summary of the command’s purpose in the Verus ecosystem.
- Clearly state the command’s category and its relationship to Verus’ protocol-level features (e.g., “This command interacts with protocol-level currencies, not smart contracts”).
- Provide a description that situates the command within Verus’ architecture (e.g., “This command manages VerusIDs, the decentralized identity system at the heart of Verus”).
- Usage, arguments, and options will be explained with reference to Verus’ unique primitives (e.g., basket currencies, PBaaS, privacy flags).
- Examples will be practical, security-conscious, and highlight both common and advanced use cases.
- Notes will always include protocol-level warnings (e.g., “Requires wallet to be unlocked”, “Irreversible action”, “Affects protocol-level state”).
- Related commands will be cross-linked, especially where protocol-level relationships exist (e.g., currency creation, identity updates, cross-chain operations).
