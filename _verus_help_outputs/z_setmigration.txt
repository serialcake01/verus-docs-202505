z_setmigration enabled
When enabled the Sprout to Sapling migration will attempt to migrate all funds from this wallet’s
Sprout addresses to either the address for Sapling account 0 or the address specified by the parameter
'-migrationdestaddress'.

This migration is designed to minimize information leakage. As a result for wallets with a significant
Sprout balance, this process may take several weeks. The migration works by sending, up to 5, as many
transactions as possible whenever the blockchain reaches a height equal to 499 modulo 500. The transaction
amounts are picked according to the random distribution specified in ZIP 308. The migration will end once
the wallet’s Sprout balance is below 0.01 VRSC.

Arguments:
1. enabled  (boolean, required) 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable respectively.
